# ACE-Edinburgh-Napier-Mobile-App

This app was solely designed and developed by Lewis Sharpe in Summer 2014 with an intern placement.

ACE stands for ‘Articulation Centre of Excellence’. Our aim? To help students such as yourself to make a smooth transition from college to university.

What is articulation?: ‘Articulation’ describes a route that allows you to progress directly from your HND or HNC to the second of third year of a university degree. Those who get involved with this are known as ‘Associate Students’.

What’s in it for me?: Becoming an Associate Student whilst studying for your HND at college has many great advantages. As an Associate Student of Edinburgh Napier journey, we will ensure your transition into 3rd year is eased. During your college studies university staff will provide tutorial support, guest lectures, university visits, academic literacy workshops and other supporting activities due to our built partnerships with local colleges.

Why Napier?: We want to help you get the degree you want and want you confident decisions by the time you enter the job market. Use this app to explore your options, and to find out how Edinburgh Napier can help you with your future.
